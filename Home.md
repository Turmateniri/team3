**Project Description**
                                                                                                                                        
This app is a Chinese Cuisine App, designed to help people who wish to make Chinese food from their home but do not know the recipes or know what ingredients they will need to make the food. They can find recipes that they can make using the ingredients they already have so that they won't have to go shopping for many different ingredients.  It will also include some interesting facts about each recipe in the recipe list.
