**Project Description**
                                                                                                                                        
This app is a Chinese Cuisine App, designed to help people who wish to make Chinese food from their home but do not know the recipes or know what ingredients they will need to make the food, find recipes that they can make using the ingredients they already have so that they won't have to go shopping for many different ingredients.  It will also include some interesting facts about each recipe in the recipe list.

 **Idea Proposal**

What is the name of the app you want to develop?

[ Chinese Cuisine App ] needs real name
  
What is/are the problem/s you want to solve?

The problem we want to solve is the misconception many people have of Chinese cuisine. Many people believe that Chinese food is similar, if not the same as take-out Chinese food. They also believe that Chinese food is tedious and difficult to make. We wish to solve these problems with our app. 
 
Who are the users you are targeting?

We are targeting people that are interested in making food at home with the ingredients they already have, no need for shopping for a lot of extra ingredients for one dish.
 
How will this app solve the tackled problem/s? Provide a vision statement.

Our app solves the problem by introducing quick and easy recipes of Chinese cuisine that people can make with the ingredients they already have.
 
What are the major features of the app?
 
Major features our app will include are: 
* A recipe list
* A search function to find recipes based on specific ingredients
* Some interesting fun-facts about each recipe

How is this app unique? Why do users need this app?
