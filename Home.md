**Project Description**
                                                                                                                                        
[Needs Description ] Chinese Cuisine App

 **Idea Proposal**

1 . What is the name of the app you want to develop? (Tentative name)

[ Chinese Cuisine App ] (needs real name)	
  
2. What is/are the problem/s you want to solve?

The problem we want to solve is the misconception many people have of Chinese cuisine. Many people believe that Chinese food is similar, if not the same as take-out Chinese food. They also believe that Chinese food is tedious and difficult to make. We wish to solve these problems with our app. 
 
4. Who are the users you are targeting?

We are targeting people that are interested in making food at home with the ingredients they already have, no need for shopping for a lot of extra ingredients for one dish.
 
5. How will this app solve the tackled problem/s? Provide a vision statement.

Our app solves the problem by introducing quick and easy recipes of Chinese cuisine that people can make with the ingredients they already have.
 
6. What are the major features of the app?
 
Major features our app will include are: 

7. How is this app unique? Why do users need this app?
 
8. What are the risks associated with the development of this app? Why wouldnâ€™t it be delivered completely (scope), on time and on budget? Identify 3 to 5 risks that are relevant in your case.
 
9. What similar apps exist on the market? (at least 5 apps with links and descriptions)
