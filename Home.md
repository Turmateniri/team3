**Project Description**
                                                                                                                                        
This app is a Chinese Cuisine App, designed to help people who wish to make Chinese food from their home but do not know the recipes or know what ingredients they will need to make the food. They can find recipes that they can make using the ingredients they already have so that they won't have to go shopping for many different ingredients.  It will also include some interesting facts about each recipe in the recipe list.

 **Idea Proposal**

* What is the name of the app you want to develop?

[ Chinese Cuisine App ] needs real name
  
* What is/are the problem/s you want to solve?

The problem we want to solve is the misconception many people have of Chinese cuisine. Many people believe that Chinese food is similar, if not the same as take-out Chinese food. They also believe that Chinese food is tedious and difficult to make. We wish to solve these problems with our app. 
 
* Who are the users you are targeting?

We are targeting people that are interested in making real Chinese food at home with the ingredients they already have, no need for shopping for a lot of extra ingredients for one dish.
 
* How will this app solve the tackled problem/s? Provide a vision statement.

Our app solves the problem by introducing quick and easy recipes of Chinese cuisine that people can make with the ingredients they already have. Where people can make and appreciate real and easy to make Chinese cuisine.
 
* What are the major features of the app?
 
Major features our app will include are: 

1. A recipe list

2. A search function to find recipes based on specific ingredients.

3. A matching service where you input all of the ingredients you currently have (in different sections e.g. protein, fish, grains, spices, vegetables, fruits), and a recipe is output with most-every ingredient consisting of something you already have. 

4. Some interesting fun-facts about each recipe

* How is this app unique? Why do users need this app?
 
* What are the risks associated with the development of this app? Why wouldnâ€™t it be delivered completely (scope), on time and on budget? Identify 3 to 5 risks that are relevant in your case.
 -There may be too many different recipes and/or ingredient combinations.

* What similar apps exist on the market? (at least 5 apps with links and descriptions)
